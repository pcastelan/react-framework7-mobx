# React + Framework7 + Mobx

This template was created with the [framework7 react template](https://github.com/framework7io/framework7-react-app-template/).

The framework7 + react template was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This template uses [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired/tree/master/packages/react-app-rewire-mobx) to allow decorators.
